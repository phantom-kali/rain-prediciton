# Rainfall Prediction Model

This project processes NetCDF rainfall dataset and builds a logistic regression model to predict rainfall occurrence using geospatial and temporal features. The model is designed to handle large meteorological datasets efficiently by processing data in chunks.

## Overview

Climate data analysis often requires processing large datasets. This project demonstrates an approach to:
- Load and process large NetCDF meteorological datasets efficiently
- Extract meaningful features from geospatial rainfall data
- Implement a machine learning model to predict rainfall occurrence
- Visualize rainfall patterns and analyze correlations
